- Decentralized energy grids allow excess energy to be distributed directly from one energy asset owner to the end consumer in a P2P trading system or fed into an already existing electricity distribution network
- Neighbourhood solutions in form of local community grids are also based on a transparent and cryptographically secure blockchain platform, which can disconnect from the larger electric grid during extreme weather conditions or other emergencies
- The coordination of renewable installations via blockchain-based systems further automatises internal operational processes, market trading and clearing mechanisms
