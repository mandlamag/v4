- Not only can insurance companies profit from quicker payment processing, but they can also benefit from blockchain-based smart contracts. These make payments conditional, automatize and streamline them and thus make the process more transparent and irrefutable in effect
- As a rule, a payment is only executed in case the pre-approved requirements or conditions are met.
- This can be applied to automated testing and payout calculation of claim and premium processing and the calculation and processing of micro-insurances
